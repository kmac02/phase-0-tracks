### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
* Minimalism: programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Make programs that work together
* Programs that handle text.
* Linux designers assume the user is competent. To assist in this, for example, common symbols maintain well known meanings: = is 'equals', + is 'plus' or 'addition', etc.
* Gives the user the power to do anything, but this also means it doesn't direct the user through a process (like a GUI does).

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* A VPS is a virtual machine that reflects how a real, dedicated server would operate. A VPS can run any operating system and the user has complete control over it. They can modify all aspects of the system. The user can also host more than one website. A VPS is also cheaper than a dedicated server, even though it's a less powerful (less space, or slower to process).

### Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
* Because the root user has so much control over the process, a careless error or mistype can be very damaging. If a program is executed by the root user, the program has root privileges and this makes the system vulnerable to attack. Someone can access the system through the program and take advantage of the root privileges to damage the system.
