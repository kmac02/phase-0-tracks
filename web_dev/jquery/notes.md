### Release 1: Plan
* Review HTML and CSS (10-15 mins)
* Locate and browse through available resources on jquery(10 mins)
* Determine which resources are best for current level of knowledge. Then organize the resources by clarity: What will be easier to read first or determine if any resources build off one another (30 mins)
* Read through the resources, take notes by hand, try to connect concepts across resources (Does anything seem contradictory? What makes one resource more comprehensible than another?)
