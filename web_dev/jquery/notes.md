### Release 1: Plan

Review HTML and CSS (10-15 mins)
Locate and browse through available resources on jquery(10 mins)
Determine which resources are best for current level of knowledge. Then organize the resources by clarity: What will be easier to read first or determine if any resources build off one another (30 mins)
Read through the resources, take notes by hand, try to connect concepts across resources (Does anything seem contradictory? What makes one resource more comprehensible than another?)
If any resources have samples to practice with, do them! (Learn by doing.)

### Release 2: Execute

I learn by doing and writing in order to familiarize myself with syntax. This is especially important for me as the coding languages will get more complex. So things like codecademy or the learn.jquery.com page are very useful.
