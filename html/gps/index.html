    <li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</li>
      <p>Semantic tags provide information about the type of content within the tag. The more descriptive ones (such as <kbd>table</kbd> or <kbd>blockquote</kbd>) are useful because the content is easily understood. Tags such as <kbd>div</kbd> or <kbd>section</kbd> are useful for grouping content on a page, but they aren't descriptive.</p>
    <li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</li>
      <p>the browser displays elements in the order they are typed</p>
    <li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</li>
      <p>Sublime has hidden depths and many useful tools. I'll likely use snippets in the future for common layouts.</p>
    <li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</li>
      <p>I feel I need to put some more time into experimenting with how elements can work with one another. For example, a section can have articles but articles can also have sections. In many instances, specific nesting is necessary (<kbd>table</kbd> holds <kbd>tr</kbd> and <kbd>th</kbd>). I think through practice and experimenting, I can learn which tags are or aren't flexible.</p>
