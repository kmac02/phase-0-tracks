    <h1>Hello readers!</h1>
    <p>Your library is a <strong>fantastic</strong> resource. Before you can use it though, you need to get a library card.</p>
    <h2>How to get a library card</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a photo ID with your city address to the library. Alternatively, you can take a utility bill from the the last 30 days or a voter registration card.</li>
      <li>Take it to your local library and show it to the librarian.</li>
      <li>Fill out the form and you're ready to go! The Librarian will do the rest.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>*Note: your local library is called a <em>branch</em></p>
      <h2>Some things you can do once you have a library card:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Checkout books, movies, music</li>
        <li>Use the Internet at the libary</li>
        <li>Request books from another library branch</li>
        <li>Borrow ebooks</li>
        <li>Brag to your friends about that great book you just read</li>
      </ul>
